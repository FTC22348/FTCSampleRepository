## How to access repository on Android Studio
Fork this repository, and then download the repository as a zip. Extract all the files and move it to your desktop. From there, open Android Studio and open a folder. This folder will look like FTCSampleRepository or whatever you named your fork of this repository. Go to the directory of FTCSampleRepository/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/. All of the formatting will be there, and you must adjust the code based on your robot's hardware, software, or even wiring to the control hub or expansion hub(s).
